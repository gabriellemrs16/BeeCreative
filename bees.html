        <h1>What Affects the Bees?</h1>
        <div class="columns">
            <div class="border">
            <h3>Pesticides</h3>
                <p>Pesticides are hurting our bees, specifically neonicotinoids. This confuses the bees internal compass so when they leave the hive to collect nectar and pollinate, they can't find their way back home. Pesticides also damage the bees central nervous system affecting their ability to eat, forage and reproduce. Therefore having a negative effect on our ecosystem.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border">
                <h3>Air Pollution</h3>
                <p>A 3-year study in India found that mildly dirty air killed up to 80% of Asian honey bees which are Asia's key pollinators. Bees pollinate 80% of the world's plants, which account for every third to fourth bite of food you take. The study also found that air pollution caused bees to become sluggish in their daily activities and shortening their lifespan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border">
                <h3>Global Warming</h3>
                <p>Since bees are cold-blooded organisms they are more active in warmer weather. Heat buildup within a bee colony can become disastrous if it gets too high. The increased warmth within the colony prompts the queen to lay more eggs, leading to increased numbers in the colony.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="border">
                <h3>Habitat Destruction</h3>
                <p>Changes in our land use have resulted in a significant loss of pollinator-friendly habitats. This leads to bees losing the diverse food sources they need for a healthy diet. In order to have a successful colony, bees need enough flowers to forage and safe places for nesting. Unfortunately since WWII, 97% of wildflower fields have been destroyed.</p>
