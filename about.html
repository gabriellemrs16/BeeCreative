        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>Air contains billions of electrically charged particles called ions. Negative ions increase the flow of oxygen to the brain and body. They feed our internal electrical systems and nourish us to improve our mood and physical health.</p>
        <p>Negative ions actually help us to feel good. When there are too many positive ions in the air around us, we are more easily irritated, feel out of sorts, experience tension and other physiological symptoms of stress. Our mood, energy and health are affected.</p>
        <p>Science has proven that any 'thing' floating in the air is 'positively charged'. This can be caused by static electricity and electromagnetic emissions from computers. Pollutants include dust and pollen, viruses, bacteria and germs. Odors from cooking, household pets, mold and mildew.</p>
        <p>Beeswax contains negative ions that bind with positive ions creating complete molecules with a balanced charge. These molecules no longer float and simply fall to the ground.</p>

                <h3>Neutralize Pollutants</h3>
                <p>Beeswax candles produce an abundance of negative ions when they are burned. These ions help to neutralize pollutants in the air. They eliminate dust and odors. It also eases allergy and asthma symptoms to improve breathing. The candles work like an indoor air purifier.</p>

        <h1>Why choose beeswax?</h1>
        <p>It is proven that people feel better when they are surrounded by the wonders of nature. This is because natural phenomena such as walking in the woods or listening to a waterfall creates an abundance of 'negative ions'.</p>
        <p>Since we live in a synthetic world where we struggle to stay in balance, it is nice to have a simple way to shift back into harmony. Enjoy burning 100% pure beeswax candles and notice the improvement in your health and well being.</p>
