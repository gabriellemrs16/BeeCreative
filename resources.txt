Like any cold blooded organism, bees are more active in warm weather. Heat buildup in a colony leads to a cause effect relationship that can become disastrous if carried too far. Increased activity by bees that are warmed up may stimulate the queen to lay eggs. This leads to a further rise in the colonyâ€™s metabolism, and as a consequence, more food is consumed and heat is produced.
